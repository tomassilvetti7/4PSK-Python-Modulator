Hello here you can find a 4PSK-modulator using Python 3.12.3
To be able to use the GUI you will need the VcXsrv app, or X server
--DOCKER
This is a project to show a dockerization of an 4PSK python-based app
I used a dockerfile to build a image an then run th python app in a container
--APP
The app haves an input to introduce a 4 character word
then it turns it into binary
then the app shows a GUI with the modulation of a digital signal using a carrier signal and a 4PSK modulator to modulate the digital signal
Enjoy!

Here you can see some screenshots
